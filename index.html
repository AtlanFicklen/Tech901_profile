                    <p>Unfortunately I don't really have any superpowers. I dont have anything that I'm exceptionally great at, which sounds more sad than it really is. I may not be really great at anything specific but I have many things that I do well, a Jack of all trades if you will. I can learn to do just about anything if I'm interested enough.
                        <p> I have always been interested in programming since I was young, wondering how the videogames I was playing really worked, but after a while that curiosity bled over into wondering how just about everything worked. I had started college in the engineering track but had to drop out of school for personal reasons, afterward programming became more interesting to me and so I enrolled in and completed the Tech901 Code 1.0 course. I want to gain more knowledge and learn skills in web programming.<p>
